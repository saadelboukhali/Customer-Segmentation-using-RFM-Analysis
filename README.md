# Customer-Segmentation-using-RFM-Analysis

What is RFM?
RFM Segmentation Analysis is a data-driven customer segmentation technique used by businesses to understand and categorize their customers based on their past purchasing behavior.
RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.

This method aims to segment customers based on three essential components of their past purchasing behavior:

• Recency (R): The time since their last purchase.

• Frequency (F): The total number of times they’ve purchased in the past.

• Monetary (M): The total amount they’ve spent.

These metrics serve as reliable indicators to efficiently identify and target distinct customer segments for marketing campaigns, aiming to retain valuable customers, engage existing ones, and re-engage those who have left.

So we will use custumer segmentation using rfm analysis for a online retail store ,
